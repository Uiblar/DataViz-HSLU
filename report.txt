What should a report contain:
- your motivation for picking up the topic

- description of the exploratory work you did (data exploration, an actual data analysis, but also
doing a review of similar work that has been already done with citations - these donâ€™t have to be
peer-reviewed papers, but can also be web-apps, journal articles etc.)

- short description of the target audience of your visualizations and how it influenced your choices

- explanation why you chose particular chart types and other visualization elements like colors,
annotations, insets, styling

- list of libraries and packages you used with a short motivation why you used those and not the
alternatives

- citations for the data source and other relevant sources

- A table summarizing who did when and how long what task during the project phase
